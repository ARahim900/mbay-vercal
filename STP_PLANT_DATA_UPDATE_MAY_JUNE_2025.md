## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Mapping
\`\`\`sql
GitHub Data Field          → Supabase Column
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Date                       → record_date
Total Treated Water        → total_treated_water  
Total TSE Water Output     → total_tse_water_output
Total Inlet Sewage         → total_inlet_sewage
Number of Tankers          → tankers_discharged
Expected Tanker Volume     → expected_tanker_volume
Direct Inline Sewage       → direct_inline_sewage
\`\`\`

### Data Quality Features
- **Automatic Efficiency Calculations:** Treatment and irrigation efficiency computed in real-time
- **Capacity Utilization Tracking:** Against design capacity of 750 m³/day
- **Maintenance Activity Logs:** Detailed daily maintenance actions preserved
- **Data Validation:** All numeric values validated and filtered
